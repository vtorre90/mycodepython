# A bakery sells loaves of bread for â‚¬3.49 each. Day old bread is discounted by 60 percent. 
# Write a program that begins by reading the number of loaves of day old bread being purchased 
# from the user. Then your program should display the regular price for the bread, 
# the discount because it is a day old, and the total price. Each of these amounts should be 
# displayed on its own line with an appropriate label. All of the values should be displayed using 
# two decimal places, and the decimal points in all of the numbers should be aligned when reasonable 
# values are entered by the user.
